# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a machine learning implementation using **Linear Regression** to predict car prices based on various features such as car name, model, engine specs, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project

The aim of this project is to predict the selling price of a car using its technical and categorical specifications. This includes features like:

- Car name and brand
- Model year
- Engine type and size
- Transmission
- Fuel type
- Mileage
- Horsepower
- And other relevant attributes

By applying **Linear Regression**, the model tries to find the relationship between these input features and the target variable: **car price**.
