# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a machine learning implementation using **Linear Regression** to predict car prices based on various features such as car name, model, engine specs, and more.

## 📌 About This Project

The aim of this project is to predict the selling price of a car using its technical and categorical specifications. This includes features like:

- Car name and brand
- Model year
- Engine type and size
- Transmission
- Fuel type
- Mileage
- Horsepower
- And other relevant attributes

By applying **Linear Regression**, the model tries to find the relationship between these input features and the target variable: **car price**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit (optional for app UI)

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using common regression metrics:

- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


🙌 Future Plans
I will continue learning more Machine Learning algorithms like:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Neural Networks
Stay connected for more projects! 😊
